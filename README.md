# Game Data Finds
## Problem Statement: 
Companies like,  Advanced Micro Devices, who also produces Graphic cards can lead to more competitions with popularity. As Nvidia continues making more advanced and efficient products, it might have an effect on people’s interests..

## Why is this interesting?:
We can learn more from seeing how new product launches per year can lead to more people being interested with searching the company up. 

## What data have you looked at and why this data answers the question?
We used Google Trends to  help us collect data on the amount of  web searches for Nvidia on the Google. With that data we were able to plot the amount of search by 5 years to see the bigger changes.


## What you learned:
Tyler’s response: I learned a lot from this project. Before the last three days i never heard of github or repl or even any understanding of coding and Navi was a great instructor in helping me understand what to do with the websites and the coding itself

Natalie’s response: I learned a lot from this project, like learning on how to use Github to coding a DataFrame in Repl.it using Python. We could also use Matplotlib for other future projects.
